Lower gastrointestinal (GI) problems rely heavily on medical imaging for diagnosis and therapy. The Kvasir dataset is a useful tool for medical imaging research, especially in the field of gastroenterology. It is made up of high-quality movies and pictures taken during endoscopic operations that show the gastrointestinal tract, including the stomach, duodenum, colon, and esophagus. The data was collected through kaggle Accurate analysis may be hampered by these pictures' frequent susceptibility to noise and distortions. In this article we report a new method using sophisticated mathematical analysis to improve and brighten pictures of the lower gastrointestinal (GI) tract, such as pylorus, normal-cecum, and ulcerative colitis images. Our goal was to enhance the picture quality through the use of various statistical filters, Gaussian functions, Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), and Inverse Fast Fourier Transform (IFFT). This would enable more precise classification and detection. According to our investigation, adaptive mean filtering plus Gaussian correction performed noticeably better than conventional bi-cubic filtering. In contrast to the bi-cubic filter, which yielded a PSNR of 42.06 and an MSE of 4.04, the combined filter technique provided a Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) of 49.44 and a Mean Squared Error (MSE) of 0.73. These findings suggest that the optimal image enhancement technique for lower GI tract exams is the combination of the adaptive mean filter and the Gaussian correction approach, which produces sharper, more detailed pictures. Additionally, the combined filter's improved image processing makes lower GI structures easier to see and understand, which helps doctors diagnose patients and plan treatments. Overall, our results highlight the value of using sophisticated filter approaches to improve image processing in lower gastrointestinal imaging, with the combined filter showing itself to be the best option for raising diagnostic precision and picture quality.
